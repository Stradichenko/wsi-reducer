# wsi-reducer

A tool to minimize the size of the WSI files for a Whole Slice Image (WSI) ML training pipeline.
This program can be used as a standalone but is primarily part of the project [gtex-image-analyzer](https://github.com/Stradichenko/gtex-image-analyzer).

## Introduction
Currently there are not proper ways to efficiently preprocess WSI for ML pipelines. Particularly concerned with SVS file type images.
This tool is meant to fulfill this need by applying a set of techniques to eliminate non essential data and compressing images in a lossless approach.
